# Homework 8: Text Markup

> Write a python script that will create clean copies of text from each issue of the “Dispatch” that you scraped before.

```
    #Define imports and source folders
    
    import re, os
    source = "./src/"
    target = "./cleaned/"


    #Import data from src folder

    filesInSrc = os.listdir(source)

    #Loop through all files from src
    for fileName in filesInSrc:

        fullPath = os.path.abspath("./src/" + fileName)

        with open(fullPath, encoding="utf8") as file:
            data = file.read()
            #Clean data using regex
            cleanData = re.sub("<[^<]+>","",data)
            print("Reading from path: ",fullPath)
