# Homework 10 + 11: Text to Map

> GISting the “Dispatch” II: Mapping geographical data from the “Dispatch”



> Extract toponyms (place names) from the “Dispatch” (python)



> Calculate their frequencies (python)



> Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)
        Hint: you can create two lists 1) one with place names and their frequencies, 2) with place names and their coordinates; after that, you can merge them with python and generate a CSV file (placename, timeParameter, latitude, longitude, frequency) which can be used for creating a map in QGIS
        
        
> Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map
