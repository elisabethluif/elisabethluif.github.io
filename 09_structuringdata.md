# Homework 9: Structuring Data

> Reformatting the “Dispatch”: generate one TSV-file with the entire content of the “Dispatch”, where each article (or, more broadly—an entry) is a single record; each record should include:
> 1. date;
> 2. type of an entry (there are articles, advertisements, notices, etc);
> 3. header;
> 4. the text of an entry.
